# Sort-Arrays
This is a program made entirely in java that is meant to sort arrays that are determined by the user using different algorithims which are also determined by the user.
All of the code used in the files are based upon the tutorials made by [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexities-of-all-sorting-algorithms/)

## [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort-algorithm-2/)
Selection Sort is an algorithim that sorts arrays through repeatidly swapping the smallest element in the array with the first unsorted element in the array

## [Bubble Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort-algorithm/)
Bubble Sort is an algorithim that sorts arrays through repeatidly swapping two adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order

## [Heap Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-sort/)
Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on [Binary Heap Data Structures](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-heap/)
> A Binary Heap is a complete Binary tree which is used to store data efficiently to get the max or min element based on its type

Heap sort can be seen as an optimization of selection sort where we first find the max element and swap it with the last element and repeating until the array is sorted.
In heap sort we use Binary Heap so we can quickly find and move the max element in a more optimized method than in selection sort
